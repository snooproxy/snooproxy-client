please note that this client is deprecated.
we are doing our best trying to develop a client that will not fucking shut down every tuesday
currently migrating to vidbinge WHVX client. don't worry as snooproxy will continue development of the new client.
note that we absolutely do not condone piracy of any kind ever. the original idea was to make movie-web closed source for educational purposes, as we thought about it, remaining the service open sourced can be a nice idea.
not to make others clone it for themselves for piracy related stuff, but for people who want to see how things work or try to play and change with things. like me. this client of snooproxy was history as no one ever used it and will remain history.
note that we are doing our best and running it at a lost. running this stuff takes a lot of money, time and effort.
vercel gives us a headache
the domain costs money
the shitty chinese backend hosting service that we use is well, shitty.
developing all this stuff takes time and effort, and we do it even when nobody uses our services.
thanks.

p.s. I suggest making snooproxy closed source as an archive. if of course developing a new client would not take 3,000,000,000 years.
